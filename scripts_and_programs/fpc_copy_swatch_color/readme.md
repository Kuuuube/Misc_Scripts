# [FPC](https://www.fountainpencompanion.com/) Get Swatch Color

On [FPC](https://www.fountainpencompanion.com/) allows viewing any ink swatch color by hovering over it or copying it by clicking on it.

## Usage

- Install the userscript. This can be done in many ways, below are two ways to install through TamperMonkey. Other extensions/add-ons may require different methods.

    Create a new script and copy-paste the contents of `fpc_get_swatch_color.js` into it.

    Open the `Dashboard`, navigate to the `Installed Userscripts` tab, and drag `fpc_get_swatch_color.js` into it.

## Dependencies

Any userscript extension/add-on. I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

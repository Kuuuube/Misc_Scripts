    - Set an env variable named `FREE_BADGE_BOT_DISCORD_TOKEN` to your token.

    - Create a file named `.env` in the directory you are running the bookmarker bot from containing `TOKEN=` followed by your token.

2. Create `free_badge_file.txt` and `fun_command_file.txt` in the directory you are running the bot.

    ```
    cargo run --release
    ```

# Youtube Remove Members Only

Removes members only videos from channel video lists.

## Usage

- Install the userscript. This can be done in many ways, below are two ways to install through TamperMonkey. Other extensions/add-ons may require different methods.

    Create a new script and copy-paste the contents of `youtube_remove_members_only.js` into it.

    Open the `Dashboard`, navigate to the `Installed Userscripts` tab, and drag `youtube_remove_members_only.js` into it.

## Dependencies

Any userscript extension/add-on. I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
